Run the following commands in the cmd or the project will not work:

pip install numpy

pip install pygame

pip install matplotlib



This project should be run in Python IDLE 3.9


If the files are not in the correct folder structure it will not work!!

Highly recommend you use my github repo rather than the raw files if you want to run the code:
